              <p class="p-heading">Claudine brings over two decades of cross-sector experience working as a transformational leader in government, education and nonprofits. She has dedicated her career to dismantling systems of oppression through education, training and leadership development, as well as through investments in community development and social movements. </p>
              <p class="separator">She currently works at the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) to mitigate the impact of gentrification and displacement in communities of color. Through her work as the South of Market (SoMa) Community Stabilization Fund Director, she collaborates with neighborhood stakeholders to negotiate and advance innovative projects that increase accessibility to affordable housing, protect existing cultural assets and support economic and workforce development. <br>
She is adept at convening and engaging stakeholders, with competing interests, to develop common ground and achieve mutually beneficial, outcome-based results. For the last year, she has advanced MOHCD’s racial equity efforts, leading its working group in creating organizational change and operationalizing racial equity principles across its programs and organizational culture. Her work is grounded in trauma informed systems.
As a consultant, she provides technical assistance and strategic planning to organizations serving communities of color.  She also developed and implemented curriculum focused on racial equity and cultural responsiveness for other consultants and community leaders.  <br>
Claudine teaches classes on history, culture and society, and systems of oppression and their intersectionalities at the University of San Francisco.  Through her relationships with community-based organizations, she engages students in service learning opportunities that connect them to their local communities and empowers them to make an impact on the various issues facing vulnerable populations, particularly in low-income communities of color. <br>
Claudine is a Rockwood Leadership Institute Women in Racial Justice and Human Rights alum, a Creating an Inclusive Environment (implicit bias training), and has trained with the Government Alliance on Racial Equity and is in the process of becoming a trainer in Trauma Informed Systems through the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
